There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Matches I could strike
To set afire the memory of you

Up goes down
Right's gone left me behind
Wheels spin 'round
Reverse stuck in my mind

There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
Naw there ain't enough
Bottles I could break
To make 'em feel as broken as I do
