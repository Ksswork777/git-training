There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Matches I could strike
To set afire the memory of you

Up goes down
Right's gone left me behind
Wheels spin 'round
Reverse stuck in my mind

There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
Naw there ain't enough
Bottles I could break
To make 'em feel as broken as I do

Stack up every barrel
Since the day it was made
Satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain
But there ain't enough
Kisses from a stranger
On a long wild night to ever make it alright
If it ain't you

In my arms, in my bed
Yeah to hell with all the rest
Once you've had the best, nothing else will do
What's the use
